# obsERVer
Identification of novel ERV integration in WGS data

The s6-v2_extract_putative_sites.py script is a replacement for the S6 script. However, this is only skeleton code at this stage, as it has not been adapted for use in other systems (dependencies etc.)
It was developed to help with ALVE annotation and validation as the numbers expanded outside the original use of obsERVer in commercial layers.
